Turbo_M:
Trains and gp-samples each TR every cycle.

Use Turbo_M but:
New TR's go into unsampled space
Use UCB to pick which TR to train and GP-sample

----------------
Current work:

Formula works. Best TR's are selected. They aren't updating though
Something is wrong with the idx's
--------------
UCB formula:

Can later add a metric for track record

v(TR_i) = -y_{i}^* + expl_weight * sqrt(TR runs/ # evals)

-------
For algorithm setup, use LHS to produce an abundance of spread out points on 
independent hyper-planes and then pull from those for each TR creation. This 
list of points can be seen as a  stack of regions because they wont be reused,
 and LHS makes sure they're independent
