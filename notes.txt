Turbo DKL:
Figure out how I want to integrate the DKL kernel into the other gp's 
Give it more passes upon new data collection



----------------
Turbo O
New TR's go into unsampled space
Use UCB to pick which TR to train and GP-sample

Formula works. Best TR's are selected. They aren't updating though
Something is wrong with the idx's

-------
For algorithm setup, use LHS to produce an abundance of spread out points on 
independent hyper-planes and then pull from those for each TR creation. This 
list of points can be seen as a  stack of regions because they wont be reused,
 and LHS makes sure they're independent


 Try turbo flip behaviour: grow/shrinking in opposite behaviour of turbo
 Slower due to more sampling in new spaces, and worse results
